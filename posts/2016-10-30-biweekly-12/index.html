<h3>Reactive Summit</h3>
<h4>Distributed stream processing with Apache Kafka</h4>
<p>My first pick is Jay Kreps' keynote on <a href="https://reactivesummit2016.sched.org/event/8B6K/distributed-stream-processing-with-apache-kafka">Distributed stream processing with Apache Kafka</a>. His articles have never failed me and this talk is no exception. He firstly argued there is an intersection between streaming processing and micro-services, which his talk is about. Then he categorized computer programming into 3 paradigms based on input / output.</p>
<ol>
<li>Request / Response. One Input and one output, and only process future input.</li>
<li>Batch. A batch of inputs and outputs, and only process past input.</li>
<li>Stream Processing. <strong>Generalization of 1 and 2</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I couldn't agree more that <strong>stream processing isn't necessarily transient, approximate and lossy</strong>. After introducing the challenges in stream processing and micro-services, he spent rest of the time on how to solve the hard parts with Kafka, Kafka Streams, Kafka Connect and Confluent platform.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Jay's keynote, especially the first half.</p>
<h4>bla bla microservices bla bla: Director’s Cut</h4>
<p>Akka inventor Jonas Boner <a href="https://reactivesummit2016.sched.org/event/7geD/bla-bla-microservices-bla-bla-directors-cut">distilled into micro-services and how to build distributed systems on it</a>. My most experiences with micro-services come from <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> and <a href="http://gearpump.apache.org">Gearpump</a>, where different system roles (actors) work asynchronously and communicate only through messages. I have no idea how micro-services work as a backend across groups in a big company. Hence, Jonas' talk, full of good quotes, looks more like a bird view to me. Nevertheless, I do remember he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;stateless&quot; architecture. It's just someone else's problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe state management and &quot;stateful&quot; API is a must-have for a stream processing system.</p>
<h4>Scala and the JVM as a Big Data Platform - Lessons from Apache Spark</h4>
<p>Dean Wampler <a href="https://reactivesummit2016.sched.org/event/7emh/scala-and-the-jvm-as-a-big-data-platform-lessons-from-apache-spark">shared how easy it is to develop distributed applications with Spark</a>. Meanwhile, the JVM has significant GC problems and Spark is fixing it with project &quot;Tungsten&quot;. What caught my eyes is the OOM issue caused by copy of 2.2GB array. The codes below, although written in Scala REPL, will be compiled into a JVM class. Then the instance, closure over <code class='language-text'>b</code>,  will be serialized and shipped to remote cluster with all of its fields including the 2.2GB array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">scala&gt; val N = 1100 * 1000 * 1000
scala&gt; val array = Array.fill[Short](N)(0)
scala&gt; val b = sc.broadcast(array)
scala&gt; sc.parallelize(0 until 100000).
     | map(i =&gt; b.value(i))
</code></pre>
<p>The solution is to either mark the array as <code class='language-text'>@transient</code> or put it into a singleton, a companion object. Please check the slides for more details.</p>
<h4>The Zen of Erlang</h4>
<p>Akka brings Erlang's actor model to JVM. <a href="https://reactivesummit2016.sched.org/event/7emY/the-zen-of-erlang">The Zen of Erlang</a>, by Fred Hebert, is almost the design patterns of Akka except for <strong>preemptive scheduling</strong>. We can't do blocking stuff in actor if a shared-thread-pool dispatcher is used. Otherwise, the whole system will be blocked.</p>
<p>Built on Akka, Gearpump employs Akka's supervision tree for fault tolerance. The supervisor will restart an application on task failures. Why restarting works ? According to Fred, there are such thing as transient bugs which are hard to find in development but happen in production all the time. Restarting heals it.</p>
<p>That's my impression on Reactive Summit so far. I'll share more as I read on. Let's turn our attention towards the Big Data community.</p>
