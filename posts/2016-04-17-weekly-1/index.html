The problem is that so much information easily wears me out. I usually put the posts in Pocket to read later but my Pocket items just keep accumulating (Yes, I'm a procrastinator). The information is not digested before going out so the good contents on the Web are not made good use of. That has troubled me for long and finally I've made my mind to write a weekly summary of what I've read over the previous week, also in the spirit of others, e.g. <a href="http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs">Cake Solutions Team Blogs</a>, <a href="https://zx31415.wordpress.com/">Fight with Infinity</a>, <a href="https://wdrl.info/">Web Development Reading List</a>, <a href="https://www.hadoopweekly.com/">Hadoop Weekly</a>. Note that it's the time when I read those articles not when they are published. As a analogy, it's processing time rather than event time in a <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101">streaming</a> system and lateness is inherent.</p>
<p>Ok, here comes the first one.</p>
<h3>Distributed Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon.com, looked back over the past 10 years of AWS and shared with us <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2016/03/10-lessons-from-10-years-of-aws.html">10 Lessons from 10 Years of Amazon Web Services</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Streaming</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apache Flink introduced first version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing">Complex Event Processing</a> library with the example of <a href="http://flink.apache.org/news/2016/04/06/cep-monitoring.html">monitoring and alert generation for a data center</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://storm.apache.org/2016/04/12/storm100-released.html">Storm 1.0.0 released</a> with a great many features.</p>
<ul>
<li>up to 16 times faster with latency reduced up to 60%</li>
<li>high volume of heartbeat writes to Zookeeper from workers has become a bottleneck for scalability. Now Storm uses <a href="http://clusterlabs.org/">Pacemaker</a>, an in-memory key/value store to process heartbeats from workers</li>
<li>distributed cache API to allow for sharing of files among topologies with backends of local file system and HDFS</li>
<li>Nimbus HA leveraging distributed cache API for replication</li>
<li>native Streaming window API</li>
<li>stateful Bolt API with automatic checkpointing</li>
<li>automatic backpressure</li>
<li>resource aware scheduler</li>
<li>dynamically change log level for a running topology</li>
<li>tuple sampling, distributed log search and worker profiling on Storm UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kafka Streams is a Java library for building distributed stream processing apps using Apache Kafka. To get a sense of it, <a href="http://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-kafka-streams-stream-processing-made-simple">Introducing Kafka Streams: Stream Processing Made Simple</a> is a nice read from Jay Kreps (author of <a href="kafka.apache.org">Kafka</a>, <a href="samza.apache.org">Samza</a>, <a href="confluent.io">Confluent</a> co-founder and CEO). I urge you to read his masterpieces if you haven't.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a sense, replacing TCP with UDP is trading off reliability for interactivity. The most critical factor in selection of one over another one is usually related to acceptable delays.</p>
