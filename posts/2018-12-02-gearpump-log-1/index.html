</code></pre>
<p>After incubating for two and a half years at Apache Software Foundation (ASF), Gearpump recently <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201809.mbox/%3CCABT57mYLRAYvVS5N2GrD-07ddAdgkf42ibZmdXpeGQHAf%2BwcDg%40mail.gmail.com%3E">retired from Apache incubator</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump">returned to GitHub home</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gearpump has been an Apache incubator sinceÂ 2016-03-08. Thank you all for help to incubate Gearpump and keep it move forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The activity around Gearpump has, however, slowed down and the last release was more than one year ago. There is no sign of a growing community, which is a requirement to be a Apache TLP. The long period of release process has made things even harder for such a slim community.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't see a future for Gearpump within Apache so it's better off to leave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think ?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>After had been the only one to develop Gearpump for a while, I finally started the discussion to retire it on dev list. We reached consensus and passed a formal vote. After another vote passed on general list, Gearpump officially retired. <strong>Note retirement doesn't mean the end of this project and Gearpump will continue on GitHub reserving all commits.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-gearpump">Apache repo</a> is archived.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[INFO] Gearpump continues on GitHub
</code></pre>
<p>A new journey has started. From now on, I'd like to log everything (commits, issues, thoughts, etc) of Gearpump . I regret not having done so earlier as I can hardly remember the early design decisions we made and why.</p>
<p>The first thing I did is adding <a href="https://github.com/fthomas/scala-steward">scala-steward</a> integration which helps to keep Gearpump's dependencies up-to-date. Scala-steward robot has opened 55 pull requests and I've merged 5 of them to update Akka, algebird, etc. It will periodically check for updates.</p>
<p>Then I planed to decompose the huge codebase into various projects under <a href="https://github.com/gearpump">gearpump group</a> since it would be too much for me to maintain and upgrade dependencies. For example, the <code class='language-text'>external-kafka</code> module depends on Kafka 0.8.2.1 which has no scala 2.12 release. I drew a graph of <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/issues/2089#issuecomment-439678535">inter-project dependency</a> with <a href="https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-project-graph">sbt-project-graph</a> and ported the external modules to <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump-externals">gearpump-externals</a> along with corresponding examples. Nonetheless, I quitted mid-way when I found it's too hard to separate out the remaining modules. Given everything is already archived at the Apache repo, I simply <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/commit/42b13c09b5e3192b0a3b760594e4ebe5b67bd68a">removed non-core modules</a>.</p>
<p>As Gearpump is no longer an Apache project, the package must be renamed from <code class='language-text'>org.apache.gearpump</code> and ASF license headers removed. It's a <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/commit/25bb3e04a5feb6e4fe639a5eea78893822f365a7">big change</a> and renaming package with Intellij pushed my 2015 Mac Pro to the limit. A <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/commit/7c94cfdb7673e9b05cd836c983c3e2fddf1d59ad">follow-up fix</a> had to be made for what I had left out.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Scala 2.12 had been on my schedule for a while but was blocked by an ancient version of <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/upickle">Upickle</a>. Upickle is the json serialization library for communication between Gearpump's dashboard and backend. The usage of Upickle has changed a lot. It used to generate reader/writers for a case class automatically while they have to be <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/commit/6c9727df81089d78627dd00de7219db56b0dbcdb#diff-315a1559a02aa4b74e0c56c13c345485">defined manually now</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/commit/78bed0b457ce7e7c4cd57f5ad6502a880f5f66f4">Upgrading to Scala 2.12</a> itself was not too much work. From the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.12.0/">release blog</a> of Scala 2.12.0</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Scala 2.11 and 2.12 are mostly source compatible to facilitate cross-building, they are not binary compatible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some notable differences are</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These <code class='language-text'>scalacOption</code>s, <code class='language-text'>-Yinline-warnings</code>, <code class='language-text'>-Yclosure-elim</code> and <code class='language-text'>-Yinline</code>, no longer exist. Here are some <a href="https://tpolecat.github.io/2017/04/25/scalac-flags.html">recommended flags for 2.12</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type inference. <code class='language-text'>-Xsource:2.11</code> can get you the old behavior and tell whether the failure is brought by changes in 2.12.</p>
<p>a.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">trait BasicService {
  private val LOG: Logger = LogUtil.getLogger(getClass) 
}
// [error] overloaded method value getLogger with alternatives
// [T](clazz: Class[T]org.slf4j.Logger &lt;and&gt;
// [T](clazz: Class[T], context: String ...)org.slf4j.Logger

private val LOG: Logger = LogUtil.getLogger(classOf[BasicService]) //OK
</code></pre>
<p>b.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">class DummyRunner[T] extends FlatMapper[T, T](FlatMapFunction(Option(_)), &quot;&quot;)
// [error] missing parameter type for expanded function

class DummyRunner[T] extends FlatMapper[T,T](
    FlatMapFunction((t =&gt; Option(t)): T =&gt; TraversableOnce[T]), &quot;&quot;) //OK

</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With these major changes, I <a href="https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/commit/08e2ac4762aa9a73ea424f1b19484e209663c9aa">bumped up the target version of next release</a> from <code class='language-text'>0.8.5-SNAPSHOT</code> to <code class='language-text'>0.9.0-SNAPSHOT</code>. Next step would be more testing and make sure there is no regression with <a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/runners/gearpump">Beam's Gearpump runner</a>. If everything is OK, then <code class='language-text'>0.9.0</code> is good to go.</p>
