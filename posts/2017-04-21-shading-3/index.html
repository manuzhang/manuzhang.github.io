<p>One one more thing is <code class='language-text'>java.lang.VerifyError</code> exceptions are thrown by JVM after the change. The work-around is adding <code class='language-text'>-noverify</code> in the JVM options. I haven't yet found the root cause and the issue is logged at <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEARPUMP-236">GEARPUMP-236</a>.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that there will be a third episode of our story with sbt shade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, here is the third episode. (The issue was resolved two months ago but my procrastination has been getting worse these days)</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="https://github.com/karol-brejna-i">Karol</a> found that the <code class='language-text'>java.lang.VerifyError</code> went away when forcing usage of asm 5.1. Thanks to his thorough investigation, I can just post his <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEARPUMP-236?focusedCommentId=15866352&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15866352">findings</a> here.</p>

<p>As stated here: <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/205#issuecomment-278287602">https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/205#issuecomment-278287602</a> there is probably a problem with shading.</p>
<p>In our tests the plugin regenerated the classes that shouldn't be impacted by shading. Moreover, the outcome of the operation made the classes not validated by JVM.</p>
<p>sbt-assembly we use (0.14.3) depends on jarjar(1.6.2)
jarjar seems to be based on org.ow2.asm 5.0.4 (<a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/jarjar/blob/master/lib/BUILD">https://github.com/pantsbuild/jarjar/blob/master/lib/BUILD</a>)</p>
<p>It seems like the bug is related to asm lib.
The experiments show that after upgrading asm to 5.1.x</p>

<p>This was also <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/205#issuecomment-279967557">confirmed by another user of sbt-assembly</a> and fixed in <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/releases/tag/v0.14.4">sbt-assembly 0.14.4</a>, and followed by asm upgrade in other downstream projects.</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/2014">BEAM-1492 Upgrade bytebuddy to 1.6.8 to jump past asm 5.0</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, should this be the final episode ? I'm afraid not. Remember there is still an open question, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40526420/sbt-published-maven-file-missing-artifacts-with-multiple-scopes">sbt published maven file missing artifacts with multiple scopes</a>.</p>
