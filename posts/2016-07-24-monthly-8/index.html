<h3>Streaming</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We introduced Kafka Streams about <a href="http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/05/29/weekly-6.html">2 months ago</a> but haven't talked about <a href="https://softwaremill.com/kafka-streams-how-does-it-fit-stream-landscape/">how does it fit the stream processing landscape?</a>. My two cents is that you get full functionality of stream processing without adding/maintaining another system if Kafka is already used. It makes much sense since the premise holds in many cases. What's different on Kafka Streams ? Michael Noll from <a href="http://www.confluent.io/">Confluent</a> wrote a series about its unique features.</p>

<p>SQL on streaming has divided into two worlds. One is <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/11/apache-spark-2-0-technical-preview-easier-faster-and-smarter.html">Spark SQL over Structured Streaming</a>. The other is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/julianhyde/streaming-sql">StreamingSQL</a> from <a href="https://calcite.apache.org/">Apache Calcite</a>, which is being integrated by Storm, Flink and Samza for their SQL layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another buzzword is IoT Analytics (with streaming). Storm PMC Taylor Goetz shared about this topic in <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ptgoetz/beyond-the-tweeting-toaster-iot-analytics-with-apache-storm-kafka-and-arduino">Beyond the Tweeting Toaster: IoT Analytics with Apache Storm, Kafka and Arduino</a>. This is, however, one-way flow of <code class='language-text'>sensor -&gt; connector -&gt; kafka -&gt; storm</code>.</p>

<p>Spotify runs its services on Google Compute Engine and adopts Google Cloud Dataflow for data processing work. They've implemented a <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio">Scala DSL</a> on top of Dataflow SDK which is now <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-302">being moved into Apache Beam</a>.

<p>Speaking of API, have you ever wondered what the relationship is between Spark's three APIs: RDD, DataFrame and Dataset? Now here is <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html">A Tale of Three Apache Spark APIs: RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets</a>.</p>

<p>Spark Summit 2016 took place from June 6 to June 8 in San Francisco. In <a href="http://datascienceassn.org/content/spark-summit-2016-review">Spark Summit 2016 Review</a> Michael Malak said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spark might have been overhyped during the 1.x days, but with Spark 2.0 it's caught up to the hype generated during the 1.0 days.</p>

<p>He said take-home projects is a better alternative. Yes, I agree and I asked the interviewers to give a brief presentation on one of <a href="https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata">awesome-bigdata</a> lists last time.</p>
