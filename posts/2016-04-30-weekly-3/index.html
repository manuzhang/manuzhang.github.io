This week we have some good stuff from both Peter, A and B.</p>
<p>In this <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/alvaro-distributed-programming">interview with Peter Alvaro on distributed computing</a>, he shared about why distributed programming is hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>distributed systems are fundamentally hard, as we have always known because of the presence and interaction of two different forms of uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two forms of uncertainty are</p>
<ol>
<li>asynchrony, which is uncertainty about the ordering and the timing at which messages will be delivered to different nodes.</li>
<li>partial failure, which means that some of your compute components may fail to run, while others keep running and your program nevertheless gives an outcome, which may be incomplete or incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other side, Peter Bailis <a href="http://www.bailis.org/blog/you-can-do-research-too/">encouraged everyone to get started in research</a> and gave an example of <em>no one is born a researcher</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my closest colleagues started off doing technical support during the first dot-com boom with only an undergraduate degree in literature and no background in Computer Science. Today, my colleague is a tenure-track professor doing work I deeply respect and admire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess who is that colleague ? Peter A !!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bailis.org/blog/">Peter B's blog</a> is the best place to know why distributed programming is hard.</p>
<p>This is the end. I mean, the end of beginning.</p>
<h3>Streaming</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mapr.com/blog/real-time-event-streaming-what-are-your-options">Real-Time Event Streaming: What Are Your Options?</a> interestingly decompose a typical streaming architecture into three major components</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Producers</strong> publish event data into a streaming system after collecting it from the data source, transforming it into the desired format, and optionally filtering, aggregating, and enriching it. (e.g. Apache Flume, Streamsets Data Collector)</li>
<li><strong>Streaming system</strong> takes the data published by the producers, persists it, and reliably delivers it to consumers. (e.g. Apache Kafka, MapR Streams)</li>
<li><strong>Consumers</strong> are typically stream processing engines that subscribe to data from streams and manipulate or analyze that data to look for alerts and insights. (e.g. Spark Streaming, Apache Storm, Apache Flink, Apache Apex)</li>
</ol>

<p>Julia Evans firstly shared his recent experience in <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/22/java-garbage-collection-can-be-really-slow/">Java garbage collection can be really know</a> and then gave <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/23/some-links-on-java-garbage-collection/">some helpful links on Java garbage collection</a></p>

<p>Daniel Spiewak <a href="https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/7a81a395c461fd3a09a6941d4cd040f2">explains Miles Sabin's magic</a> in fixing <a href="https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-2712">SI-2172</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">def foo[F[_], A](fa: F[A]): String = fa.toString

type IntConsumer[A] = Int =&gt; A

val f: IntConsumer[Int] = { x: Int =&gt; x * 2 }
foo(f)           // nope!         
</code></pre>
<p>The above should compile now in Scala 2.12.</p>
