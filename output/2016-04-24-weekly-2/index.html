<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Campbell_(business_executive)">Bill Campbell</a> passed away last week. Honestly, I've never heard of this name before but the &quot;Coach&quot; has deeply influenced the Silicon Valley, tutoring Steve Jobs, Jeff Beros, Google founders, Ben Horowitz and countless others. Ben Horowitz <a href="https://medium.com/@bhorowitz/bill-d9151e6f7538#.fwusr99qy">expressed his sorrows</a> starting with the above poem.</p>
