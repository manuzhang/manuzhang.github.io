The conference was full of great contents from Apache Big Data projects. My colleagues Karol and Huafeng  co-presented <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/Apache%20Gearpump%20-%2016-9.pdf">Apache Gearpump Next-Gen Streaming Engine</a> with the use case of Gearpump-on-<a href="http://trustedanalytics.org/">TAP</a> and latest performance data. Huafeng also <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/Streaming%20Report.pdf]">gave a report comparing modern stream processing engines on functionalities and performances</a>.  I will write more about my takes here after going through the slides.</p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-0-2.html">Apache Spark 2.0.2</a> has been released containing stability fixes. All 2.0.x users are strongly recommended to upgrade. Kafka 0.10 and runtime metrics have been added for Structured Streaming.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kafka</h3>
<p>Kafka made up a large part of my readings last week.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anil Kumar from WalmartLabs wrote about how Kafka has decentralized autonomous services and enabled agile development in <a href="https://medium.com/walmartlabs/apache-kafka-for-item-setup-3fe8f4ba5967#.8bj3haxas">Apache Kafka for Item Setup</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confluent <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/unifying-stream-processing-and-interactive-queries-in-apache-kafka/">announced Interactive Queries for Kafka Streams</a>. The queryable states are stored in embedded databases like <a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>. Under the hood, each Kafka Streams instance exposes its metadata which a developer could obtain for a given store name and key through Interactive Query APIs. There is no built-in RPC layer for distributed querying but Confluent provides a [reference REST-based implementation](REST-based implementation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confluent also <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-contributions-to-the-apache-kafka-client-ecosystem">walked through their contributions to Kafka Client Ecosystem</a>. Besides the Java client, they have focused on making high quality C client and wrap C client for clients in other languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kafka Streams is a lightweight library and has no built-in scheduler or cluster support. How can it be scaled ? <a href="http://aseigneurin.github.io/2016/10/07/kafka-streams-scaling-up-or-down.html">Kafka Streams - Scaling up or down</a> explains it with a simple example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scaling of Kafka Streams is built on Kafka's consumer group and its rebalancing feature. Here is article to hep you <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-kafka-consumer-groups-and-consumer-l">understand Kafka consumer groups</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deep Learning and AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What Artificial Intelligence Can and Can’t Do Right Now ? Andrew Ng gives his <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now">answers</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What AI can do ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>What AI can't do ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI work requires carefully choosing A and B and providing the necessary data to help the AI figure out the A→B relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A is the input and B is the response.  The necessary data means a huge amount of data which Andrew calls Achilles' heel in today's supervised learning software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Algorithmia shared about their <a href="http://blog.algorithmia.com/deploying-deep-learning-cloud-services/">lessons learned in deploying deep learning at scale</a>. They find the cloud is in its infancy to deploy models into production.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for this week. Happy Reading !</p>
