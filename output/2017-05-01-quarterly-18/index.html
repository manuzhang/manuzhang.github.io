My Pocket list has been piling up (125 read-it-later) and I can no longer pretend the world doesn't change. It is revolving super fast. Unlike previous readings where we dived into technique details, we will look more from outside this time.</p>
<h3>Acquisition</h3>
<p>While the big fish looks to fill in the missing part of its software stacks, the small fish seeks for sustainably growth and profit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/27/mozilla-acquires-pocket/">Mozilla Acquires Pocket</a>. Pocket started out as a Firefox add-on and finally has become part of it. Let's see how the integration could go deeper after the acquisition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/welcome-Kaggle-to-Google-Cloud.html">Kaggle joins Google Cloud</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Founded in 2010, Kaggle is home to the world's largest community of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could make deployment of machine learning algorithms much easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/">Gitter has been acquired by GitLab</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next piece of wow: we will be open sourcing all of the Gitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gitter will be like GitLab, which allows you to setup your own GitHub.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Business story</h3>
<p>Another topic I rarely mention but is worth bringing up.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://producthabits.com/why-trello-failed-to-build-a-1-billion-business/">Why Trello Failed to Build a $1 Billion+ Business</a></p>
<p>Actually Trello has more than 19M users and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/atlassian-acquires-trello/">was sold to Atlassian for $425M</a>, but it fell short in monetization and its main features were easily copy-catted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/intel-mobileye-and-smiling-curves/">Intel, Mobileye, and Smiling Curves</a></p>
<p>A mind-blown post on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-to-buy-mobileye-for-15-3-billion-1489404970">Intel's purchase of Mobileye</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiling_curve">smiling curve</a> is introduced to explain the value added by different players in the industry of PCs, Phones, Servers and future Cars, and thus the context of this purchase.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Road Ahead</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.bradfordcross.com/blog/2017/3/3/five-ai-startup-predictions-for-2017">Five AI Startup Predictions for 2017</a> by Bradford Cross, who has been working with AI for nearly 20 years, and building silicon valley AI startups for nearly 10 (which leads to the fifth point).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bots go bust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the current mania around ‘bots’ defined as conversational interfaces over voice and chat will begin its collapse in 2017</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep learning goes commodity</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am suggesting that deep learning will become more commodity among machine learning people this year, but i am not suggesting that machine learning itself will become commodity.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI is Cleantech 2.0 for VCs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the batch that are diving in at the top of this pre-mania are making the same mistake that cleantechs did -- they are diving into AI instead of diving into a customer need.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>MLaaS dies a second death</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the people that know what they’re doing just use open source, and the people that don’t will not get anything to work, ever, even with APIs</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full stack vertical AI startups actually work</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vertical AI startups solve full-stack industry problems that require subject matter expertise, unique data, and a product that uses AI to deliver its core value proposition.</p>
