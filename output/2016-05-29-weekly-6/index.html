I gave a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/manuzhang/apache-gearpump-lightweight-runtime-streaming-engine">sharing on Gearpump</a> at 5th Nanjing Big Data Tech Meetup on Saturday and I'd been busy preparing materials the week before. The only news that caught my eyes was <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/inside-palantir-silicon-valleys-most-secretive-company?utm_term=.onev4ekN6#.ihn1Q23KP">Inside Palantir, Silicon Valleyâ€™s Most Secretive Company</a> on Palantir's grow-up struggles. I was not convinced since losing customers could happen to any startups. Now please read <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2016/05/11/palantir-struggles/">The Real Lesson for Data Science That is Demonstrated by Palantir's Struggles</a>. Sold?</p>
<p>Let's get down to this week's readings.</p>
<h3>Streaming</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.confluent.io/blog/announcing-apache-kafka-0.10-and-confluent-platform-3.0">Apache Kafka 0.10 and Confluent Platform 3.0 is announced</a>. Highlights of Kafka 0.10</p>
<ul>
<li>Kafka Streams available</li>
<li>Rack awareness so that replicas are guaranteed to span multiple racks or available zones</li>
<li>Timestamps in messages indicates the time message produced</li>
<li>Kafka Consumer max records</li>
</ul>
<p>More on Kafka Streams. Unlike other distributed streaming engines (e.g. Storm, Spark Streaming), a Kafka Streams instance (program) is simply a Java process which is run on one ore more threads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kafka Streams applications can run on YARN, be deployed on Mesos, run in Docker containers, or just embedded into existing Java applications.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/open-sourcing-twitter-heron">Twitter just open sourced Heron</a>, the successor to Storm as real-time stream processing engine at Twitter. It provides backward compatibility with Storm's Topology API. Please go to their <a href="http://heronstreaming.io/">website</a> for more information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft published a new paper <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/24/streamscope-continuous-reliable-distributed-processing-of-big-data-streams/">StreamScope: Continuous Reliable Distributed Processing of Big Data Streams</a> in NSDI '16. After a quick glance, they didn't go beyond <em>watermark</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spark</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/19/approximate-algorithms-in-apache-spark-hyperloglog-and-quantiles.html">Spark has implemented approximate Algorithms. HyperLogLog and Quantiles in 2.0</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Others</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Julia Evans <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/">shared some advice on writing blog posts</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like writing short blog posts because I have a short attention span and I find short blog posts easier to digest when other people write them.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, blogging should never burden you or your readers. That's it.</p>
