The topic has been keeping its momentum this week,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/exactly-not-atomic-broadcast-still-impossible-kafka/">Exactly-once or not, atomic broadcast is still impossible in Kafka – or anywhere</a></li>

<li><a href="https://softwaremill.com/what-kafka-exactly-once-really-means/">What does Kafka's exactly-once processing really mean?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>but I will refrain myself from talking more since there is a lot to catch up.</p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apache Beam <a href="https://beam.apache.org/blog/2017/05/17/beam-first-stable-release.html">published first stable release 2.0.0</a>. They went up directly from 0.6.0 to join <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/06/cloud-dataflow-20-sdk-goes-ga">Cloud Dataflow 2.0 SDK</a> which is based on Beam 2.0.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apache Storm community <a href="http://storm.apache.org/2017/07/28/storm104-released.html">released 1.0.4</a>, a maintenance release along the 1.0.x line. Note Storm also has a <a href="http://storm.apache.org/2017/03/29/storm110-released.html">1.1.x line with Streaming SQL and Kafka 0.10 support</a>. I guess they try to stick to <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and</li>
<li>PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The downside is now two minor versions have to be maintained for bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apache Flink has made the fourth major release <a href="http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/06/01/release-1.3.0.html">1.3.0</a> shortly followed by bug-fix release <a href="http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/06/23/release-1.3.1.html">1.3.1</a>. Some notable new features are incremental checkpointing for RocksDB, side outputs, support for retractions in Table API/SQL. This is also a bug-fix version, <a href="http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/04/26/release-1.2.1.html">1.2.1</a> for 1.2 series. In the future,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users can expect Flink releases now in a 4 month cycle. At the beginning of the 1.3 release cycle, the community decided to follow a strict <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Time-based+releases">time-based release model</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Gearpump has also made a <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319920&amp;version=12340225">bug-fix release, 0.8.4</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Java land</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=6016">Jigsaw finally completed</a>, Java 9 is around the corner (Sep. 21st). Azul blog has made a <a href="https://www.azul.com/jdk-9-pitfalls-for-the-unwary/">summary of required changes when upgrading to Java 9</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wondering how to take advantage of Single Instruction, Multiple Data(SIMD) in Java ? <a href="http://prestodb.rocks/code/simd/">There is no way to use SIMD intrinsics in Java directly, as of Java 8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brendan Gregg has made a <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-06-30/package-flame-graph.html">Java Package Flame Graph</a> to visualize which package has taken up most CPU time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kotlin is trending as <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html">Android makes it an official language</a>. Why not Scala which also has <a href="http://scala-android.org/">Android support</a> ? <a href="https://www.reactivesystems.eu/2017/05/21/java-scala-kotlin-skiing.html">This is how a Scala developer takes it by drawing an analogy to skiing</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it but I still have more than 50 articles in my Pocket(read-it-later App). &quot;read-it-later&quot; is actually becoming &quot;never read&quot;. That has made me to start a new experiment, <a href="https://github.com/manuzhang/read-it-now">read-it-now</a>, to improve my reading quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than saving an article to Pocket to read it later, I’d like to read it now, take notes and put down my thoughts in a GitHub issue</p>
