The <a href="http://manuzhang.github.io/2016/12/11/triweekly-15.html">last reading</a> was more than a month ago and articles have been piling up in my Pocket list. Not to overburden and scare off myself from this routine, I'd like to just do a biweekly reading to start again. Another reason is the value of news decay quickly as the value of data. I'll start with open source releases.</p>

Eric Brewer, the author of CAP and VP of Google Cloud <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/02/inside-Cloud-Spanner-and-the-CAP-Theorem.html">shared his idea</a>. Spanner is technically a CP system while providing more than five 9s of available in practice. It is achieved through Google's private network.</p>
